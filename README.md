ðŸŒ± Carbon & Water Footprint Predictor

- This repository contains a small end-to-end project that estimates the carbon and water impact of beauty products.
- A trained Random Forest model is wrapped inside a simple Streamlit web app, letting anyone enter product details and see an instant footprint estimate.


Purpose:-
- Provide a quick way to approximate the environmental impact of different product designs.
- Demonstrate multi-output regression in scikit-learn with a clean, minimal UI.
- Support future experiments for sustainability-focused initiatives.


Key Features:- 
- Interactive UI: sliders and dropdowns for product details.
- Multi-target Model: predicts both carbon (kg COâ‚‚e) and water (liters).
- Easy Retraining: run a single script to rebuild the model on updated data.
- Lightweight Deployment: Streamlit runs locally or can be hosted on any platform supporting Python.
